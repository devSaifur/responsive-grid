                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                  were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                  honestly feel I got every penny&#39;s worth.

                  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                  I&#39;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                  people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                  free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                  shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                  grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                  I&#39;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
                  Engineer at a VR startup. ”

              <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
              <p>
                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I&#39;ve never written a line of
                code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
                learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
                the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&#39;ve often referred to
                it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
                It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
